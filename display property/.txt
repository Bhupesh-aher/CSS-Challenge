learn about 

- display property - how a element can redner on UI we can do that by display property
  - block
  - box-sizing (explaination in notes)
  - inline
  - inline-block (combination of block type element and inline element)
 


1. block elements -
    - div
    - p
    - h1
    - many more

    a. it always comes to new line (always render to next line)
    b. it takes width from extreme left to extrme right (takes full space in context of width by default)
    c. we can change height and width
    d. we can change margin and padding


2. inline elements - 
    - anchor tag
    - span 
    - many more

    a. if width is available then it tries to come in same line
       for example if there are multiple span one after another then they will come in same line and if space is not there then they will come in next line
       in short if width is available then they will come in same line  and if width is not available then they will come to next line (they go to next line)
    b. whatever width of content is, inline element will take that much width
    c. no custom width and height
    d. no custom margin on vertical side but we can give it margin on horizontal side
    e. we can give custom padding 
    

- span tag by defalut is inline element we can covert it into block type element
- example 
   span {
    display : block;
   }
   after doing this we can give custom height, width, margin on vertical side 


just like we covert inline element into block type element we can covert block element into inline element


3. inline-block - 
  - it behavious like inline element but we can give custom width and height and custom margin on both side as well
  - still it will come side by side (on same line, 2.b) but we can give custom height and width
